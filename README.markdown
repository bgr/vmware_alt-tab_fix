This AutoHotKey script attempts to alleviate the problem with windows not
getting focus in VMWare Player's Unity mode when switching using Alt-Tab or
clicking taskbar buttons.

I'm having this problem on Windows 10 host with VMWare Player running
Ubuntu 15.04 guest. The script works most of the time, although it still
has some problems.
