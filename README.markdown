This [AutoHotkey](http://ahkscript.org/) script attempts to alleviate the
problem with windows not getting focus in VMware Player's Unity mode when
switching using Alt-Tab or clicking taskbar buttons.

I'm having this problem on Windows 10 host with VMware Player running
Ubuntu 15.04 guest. The script works correctly most of the time, although
it might still cause some rogue clicks.
